# ETL
## Overview:
This project involves extracting data from Kaggle API, performing data cleaning and transformation using Python, and loading the cleaned data into MySQL for further analysis. The goal is to prepare the data for analysis and gain insights through data visualization and querying.

## Steps:
### Data Extraction:
Data is extracted from Kaggle API using Python scripts.
### Data Cleaning and Transformation:
* Data cleaning is performed using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.\
* Steps include handling missing values, removing duplicates, converting data types, and standardizing formats.\
* Data transformation techniques such as feature engineering may be applied to derive new insights.
### Loading Data into MySQL:
* Cleaned data is loaded into MySQL database using Python and SQLAlchemy.\
* Tables are created in MySQL to store the structured data.\
* Data integrity and consistency are ensured during the loading process.\
### Data Analysis:
* Once the data is loaded into MySQL, various data analysis techniques can be applied.\
* SQL queries are executed to extract insights from the data.\
* Data visualization techniques may be employed using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## Repository Contents:
